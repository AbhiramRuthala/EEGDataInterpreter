**Predicting brain waves using the frequency value from non-stationary data of EEG recordings**

NOTE: This system is coded using the Python3 coding language

**Input**
When the program is run, the input is taken by the user which is a number.

**Checking on the list**
This number will be checked across the entire list (matrix2 in the code) to see if that value is within the content of the list. This will be checked as either "True" or "False" by the variable "check" in the "if" statement in the bottom. If check is equal to True, then the function will print a value by checking for the input of the user in the "frequency" dictionary.

**Dictionary**
A dictionary is a place to store values and "KeyValues." As shown in the code, the string on the right side of the code is the KeyValue, while the left is the string that holds it.
