**Predicting brain waves using the frequency value from non-stationary data of EEG recordings**

NOTE: This system is coded using the Python3 coding language

When the program is run, the input is taken by the user which is a number.

This number will be checked across the entire list (matrix2 in the code) to see if that value is within the content of the list. This will be checked as either "True" or "False" by the variable /check
